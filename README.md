## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles

### Continued development
For the most part, I haven't tried much making the web apps look exactly as the problem. 
I would most probably go back and try to replicate it better.

### Useful resources
